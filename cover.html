        Hi,
        <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the available job opportunity at your company. I’ve 10+ years of professional IT experience. I have successfully delivered enterprise-grade microservices, data-pipelines and APIs in a distributed multi-cloud environment with high scalability, reliability and availability requirements. I’ve set up projects from scratch, including project structure, unit tests, monitoring, CI/CD. I’m skilled in using Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, SRE, system design and data-structures.</p>
        <p>In my present role at Walmart, I’m a Sr. Software Engineer, in the SRE team where I architect and implement solutions that help product teams to monitor and set up alerts for their services, improving MTTD and MTTR in prod. During my tenure at ThoughtWorks, I led projects starting from inception, release planning and delivery with agile practices. I’ve been a backend software developer for the most part of my career. I value inclusivity, diversity, creativity and collaboration and I love to be among empathetic intellectuals.</p>
        <p>I’m looking forward to knowing more about this opportunity.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Sincerely,<br />
            Vikas Kaushik</p>

<!-- <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the available job opportunity at your company. In over 10 years
    of professional IT experience, I have successfully delivered enterprise-grade applications, microservices,
    and libraries, including tests, instrumentation, and monitoring in production. My expertise lies in ensuring
    scalability, reliability, and availability in all projects I undertake.</p>

<p>I am hands-on in Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD setup, deployments, Kafka, Prometheus, and Grafana, and
    well-versed in data structures and system design. At Walmart, I am responsible for designing and
    implementing SRE solutions, including autoscaling and anomaly detection systems, K8s operators, showback
    services, onboarding APIs, and Prometheus exporters. During my tenure at ThoughtWorks, I developed
    cloud-based enterprise web applications and data pipelines using a wide range of technologies, including
    Golang, C#, React-JS, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, OAuth, CI/CD, REST APIs, and microservices.
</p>

<p>I thrive in an environment that values inclusivity, diversity, creativity, sustainability, and collaboration.
    As an empathetic intellectual and first principle thinker, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality work
    and making a valuable contribution to the team's goals and milestones.</p>

<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the role further and how I can contribute to
    your organization's success</p> -->
