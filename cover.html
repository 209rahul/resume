        <p>Dear Recruiter,</p>

        <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the available job opportunity at your company. In
            over 10 years of professional IT experience, I have successfully delivered enterprise-grade
            applications, microservices and libraries, including tests, instrumentation and monitoring in
            production. My expertise lies in ensuring scalability, reliability, and availability in all projects I
            undertake.</p>

        <p>I am hands-on in Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD setup, deployments, Kafka,
            Prometheus, Grafana, and well-versed with data structures and system design. At Walmart,
            I am responsible for designing and implementing SRE solutions, including autoscaling and
            anomaly detection systems, K8s operators, showback services, onboarding APIs, and
            Prometheus exporters. During my tenure at ThoughtWorks, I developed cloud-based
            enterprise web applications and data pipelines using a wide range of technologies,
            including Golang, C#, React-JS, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, OAuth, CI/CD, REST APIs,
            and microservices.
        </p>

        <p>I thrive in an environment that values inclusivity, diversity, creativity, sustainability, and
            collaboration. As an empathetic intellectual and first principle thinker, I am dedicated to
            delivering high-quality work and making a valuable contribution to the team's goals and
            milestones.</p>

        <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the role further and how I can contribute to
            your organization's success</p>

        <p>Sincerely,<br />
            Vikas Kaushik</p>
