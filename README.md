## 💼 Resume - Vikas Kaushik 👨🏻‍💻

Subject: Experienced Software Developer seeking job opportunities

Hi,

I’ve 10+ years of professional IT experience. I have successfully delivered enterprise-grade microservices, data-pipelines and APIs in a distributed multi-cloud environment with high scalability, reliability and availability requirements. I’ve set up projects from scratch, including project structure, unit tests, monitoring, CI/CD. I’m skilled in using Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, SRE, system design and data-structures.

In my present role at Walmart, I’m a Sr. Software Engineer, in the SRE team where I architect and implement solutions that help product teams to monitor and set up alerts for their services, improving MTTD and MTTR in prod. During my tenure at ThoughtWorks, I led projects starting from inception, release planning and delivery with agile practices. I’ve been a backend software developer for the most part of my career. I value inclusivity, diversity, creativity and collaboration and I love to be among empathetic intellectuals.

I’m looking forward to knowing more about this opportunity.


Thanks,
Vikas Kaushik
